It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.","indicator_name":"Arbeitslosenquote, nach Geschlecht, Alter und Personen mit Behinderungen","indicator_sort_order":"08-05-02","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"8","target_name":"Bis 2030 produktive Vollbesch\u00e4ftigung und menschenw\u00fcrdige Arbeit f\u00fcr alle Frauen und M\u00e4nner, einschlie\u00dflich junger Menschen und Menschen mit Behinderungen, sowie gleiches Entgelt f\u00fcr gleichwertige Arbeit erreichen","target_id":"8.5","un_custodian_agency":"International labour organization (ILO)","un_designated_tier":"1","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-11-23: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/trm02001/UCDSDGsdata/commit/e8bfc91348ab62c25f15bda813e4f6dffd6f8ada","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-11-23: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/trm02001/UCDSDGsdata/commit/e8bfc91348ab62c25f15bda813e4f6dffd6f8ada","page_content":"","indicator":"8.5.2"}
